# Tools for developers

Here is a list of some topics/tools frequently encountered in software development.
Resources for learning them are also included.
These appear roughly in decreasing order of importance in my opinion.
They are easy and you can learn them in a short time.
They have also been rated on the basis of difficulty
by [Eklavya Sharma](https://github.com/sharmaeklavya2), the original author of this article.
This rating is relative, so even a 5-star rating is not very hard.
Time to learn a topic is roughly proportional to difficulty.
It's okay to be [lazy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation)
and learn them only when you need to.
